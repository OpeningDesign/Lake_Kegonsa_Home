Lake Kegonsa House
============

A major house renovation on [Lake Kegonsa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3232+Aalseth+Ln,+Stoughton,+WI+53589/@42.94901,-89.25464,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88064f5076276249:0x2fda5a143436c772)

Similar to our [IFCopenHouse](https://github.com/OpeningDesign/IFCopenHouse_Lantern_Hollow) we're using this open source project to try and push [openBIM](http://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/technical-vision/) even further.

============
We are always looking to collaborate with a select team of individuals who are also excited about the benefits of working  <a href="#in-the-open">in the open</a> and pushing the bounds of existing and new IFC workflows.

One of our mantras is, "Specialize, Specialize, Specialize!".  Over the years we would like to build a trusted network of highly specialized collaborators agile enough to tackle the most obscure problems.

Although, currently we're looking for a **structural engineer** to collaborate with on this project, if you're a AEC consultant also interested in this 'open' way of working, shoot us an email at <ahref="mailto:hello@openingdesign.com">hello@openingdesign.com</a>. It would be great to work with you in the future.

####In-the-Open

All of OpeningDesign's projects are conducted out in the open.  That is, during the development of any one project, all team communication and content is hosted [publicly](https://github.com/OpeningDesign) and is <a href="#license">open source</a>.

Since we believe that [innovation happens elsewhere](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS591US591&ion=1&espv=&ie=UTF-8&q=innovation%20happens%20elsewhere) we would like to lower, as much as possible, the barrier for others to collaborate and contribute.
