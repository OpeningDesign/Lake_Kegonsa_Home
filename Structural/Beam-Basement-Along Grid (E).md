# 2. Input Summary.

## 2.1. Applicable codes.  
2.1.1. Wisconsin Administrative Code, Chapter SPS 321 â€“ Uniform Dwelling Code  
2.1.2. ASCE 07-05, Minimum Loads on Buildings    
  
## 2.2. Design considerations.

Span tables are used to determine minimal section.

Reference design: Weyerhaeuser Microllam LVL Beams p.14-15

## 2.3. Load values

Dead Load Calculation:

Minimum value:                 Dmin = 10 psf;

Flooring: Wood Joists w/ Wood flooring     D1 = approx. 12 psf;

Walls: light-frame wood walls        D2 = approx 6 psf

Max D1+D2+D3 & Dmin            **D = D1+D2 = 18 psf**

**D** = 18 psf        as per WAC Chapter SPS 321, calculation  
**L** = 40 psf        as per WAC Chapter SPS 321 Table 321.02

## 3. Structural Design.

    Load Width 1 = 8.28'

    Load Width 2 = 0'

    Beam Span = 14.18'
	
	**Wd** = 18*8.28 = 0.149 kip/ft 

	**Wl** = 40*8.28 = 0.331 kip/ft
	
	Total distributed load (via existing joists) = 18 * 8.28 + 40 * 8.28 = 0.48 kip/ft
	
	Reactions at supports:
	
	**Rd** = Wd * 14.18 / 2 = 1.05 kip
	
	**Rl** = Wl * 14.18 / 2 = 2.35 kip
