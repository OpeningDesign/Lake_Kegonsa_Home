# 2. Input Summary.

## 2.1. Applicable codes.  
2.1.1. Wisconsin Administrative Code, Chapter SPS 321 â€“ Uniform Dwelling Code  
2.1.2. ASCE 07-05, Minimum Loads on Buildings    
  
## 2.2. Design considerations.

Span tables are used to determine minimal section.

Reference design: Weyerhaeuser Microllam LVL Beams p.14-15

## 2.3. Load values

Dead Load Calculation:

Minimum value:                 Dmin = 10 psf;

Flooring: Wood Joists w/ Wood flooring     D1 = approx. 12 psf;

Walls: light-frame wood walls        D2 = approx 6 psf

Max D1+D2+D3 & Dmin            **D = D1+D2 = 18 psf**

**D** = 18 psf        as per WAC Chapter SPS 321, calculation  
**L** = 40 psf        as per WAC Chapter SPS 321 Table 321.02

## 3. Structural Design.

    Load 1: concentrated load from Basement beam along grid (E)
	
	Pd = 1.05 kip
	
	Pw = 2.35 kip

    Load 2: distributed load from 2nd floor, load area width = 7'

	**Wd** = 18*5 = 0.090 kip/ft 

	**Wl** = 40*5 = 0.200 kip/ft
	
    Beam Span = 12'
	
	Max Moment = 12.46 kip-ft @ 4.3 ft
	
	Max Shear = 3.52 kip @ 0 ft
		
## 4. Design Results

Basement Beam along Grid (3):

Base section: 1.75" x 9.5"
Allowable Moment:  5.885 kip-ft
Allowable Shear:   3.160 kip

Minimum design section is 3 x Base Section, i.e. 5.25" x 9.5"
